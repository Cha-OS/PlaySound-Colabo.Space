# Colabo.Space Extension

Added `colabo.config.js` configiration file in the frontend root

Updated `tsconfig.json` with include to puzzles (although it didn't complain?!)

TODO:

+ Instructions on 
    + adding Colabo.Space repo to the system
        + maybe avoid it, just put in npm dependencies external built npm packages
    + adding colabo.tools globally
        + maybe not necessary, only for development
        + and even then it can be just global build, same as ng, etc
    + external puzzles from Colabo.Space
        + probably not necessary
        + maybe avoid it, just put in npm dependencies external built npm packages

# Development

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
