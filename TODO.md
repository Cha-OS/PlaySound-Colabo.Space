# Intro

We see 4 fundamental task categories

1. fixing PS (PlaySound) to be ng6+ compatible and easy to develop
2. adding features you need (sessions, extended chat, remote playing)
3. describing methodologies
    + this is something that is not code related, but rather new use cases
    + like the one we did for PTW, program music, etc, that were done with the current PS
4. extension of PS to support more advanced use-cases and methodologies that you/we anticipate
    + this will help us to encode methodologies (3. category) in a more controlled way
    + this will help us with more advanced methodologies

## Migrating to modern Angular (6+)

+ Create a working hybrid project
+ It will keep regular working version of original project, but wrapped in `ng6+` container
+ We can then program in much healthier environment with much cleaner code and structure
+ We can add ***Colabo.space puzzles*** (components/packages)
+ We can still use old code within new code, and new code within old code, so no pain
+ You can still continue to program in old AngularJS, but that is not recommended :)
+ we can incrementally migrate to new code

## Provide Audio Commons access

+ Integrate Javascript library for access to the Audio Commons ecosystem

## Advance Models of pseudo-real-time performance

+ Queued/Delayed/Pseudo real-time performance
+ Component for designing sounds queue with parameters

## Advanced Models of real-time performance

+ Colabo.Space : TopiChat
    + Support for sessions
    + Support for chat
    + references to entities (sounds) from chat

## Integration with Art & Science Use Cases

+ Integrate with artistic usecases through Colabo.Space ecosystem
+ Usecases
    + [CoLaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/)
    + [Poetry on the Road](http://colabo.space/colaboarthon/poetry_on_the_road/)
    + DialoGame

### Everydays Heroes (Dresden, Germany)

+ TBD

### Performance at PTW (New York, USA)

#### In a nutshell

+ we are using **collaborative augmentation** Tools and Methodologies (articulated through  [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/)) to help building and rolling **the wheel (a dialogue) between Science->Art->Society**
+ We are starting with **D.C.Engelbart vision** of Collective Intelligence and and ***UN SDGs*** transforming it into a practice with international practitioners of **Performance Activism**
+ We want to offer a great **opportunity of pseudo-real-time performance** for the Open Band at this event, and producing a program music for each performer's performance and performances' fusions
+ We will aim to do ***awareness initiation*** and **psycho-behavioral matching** between musicians and performers to find the best matches. We will do it online with **AI augmented NLP tools @ Colabo.Space**
+ We will **credit work** of PlaySound, Open Band, Audio Common projects and teams

#### More Details

+ PlaySound **Integration with Art & Science** Use Cases
+ [PTW (Perform The World) Conference](https://performingtheworld.pathable.com/), New York, 21-23. September
+ Founded by ***Patch Adams*** and few other key players in Performance Activism
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams
    + [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams_(film)) with Robin Williams
    + http://www.patchadams.org/
+ Our workshop is focused on [ColaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/) methodology and [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/) augmentation technology
+ We are starting with **Science and facts**: [UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and [Douglas C Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) as futurist, father of GroupWare, computer collaborative augmentation and Collective Intelligence
+ We use (*ColaboArthon, CoEvoLudens, DialoGame*) methodologies augmented with Colabo.Space to translate it into artistic, performing and moving aspect, and using [Vygotsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky)  *"[A Head Taller](https://www.joanwink.com/vision-of-vygotsky/vision-of-vygotsky-children-at-play-through-page-115/)"* methodology to transform a vision of ***Collective Mind*** into action

#### Methodologies/Tools

We have **methodologies/tools (online/offline)** that participants do at the beginning of work and they help us to understand who ***matches*** whom, to ***tune*** them, and potentially what ***psychological profile*** they are. 

Some of them are free form text expressions so we use ***NLP*** and ***AI*** tools to analyze

**Offline tools**: we use various, most of them are team building methodologies, some of them we designed as collective awareness, where participants in the room are interacting with each others, talking, physical interaction, etc

**Online tools** (that we used at the PTW conference):

+ we were using first **offline awareness** and then 
+ online (mobile) **SDG selections** (UN SDG, there is in the TODO), and then we are using cluster matching
+ online (mobile) **CWC (Coaching with Compassion) dreaming** (textual) and then using AI + NLP tools to math it, extract topics
+ later we **augment online+offline DialoGame** with AI findings from CWC and SDGs

This is a brief explanation if that helps, I can eventually elaborate more or demonstrate
