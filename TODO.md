## Migrating to modern Angular (6+)

+ Create a working hybrid project
+ It will keep regular working version of original project, but wrapped in `ng6+` container
+ We can then program in much healthier environment with much cleaner code and structure
+ We can add ***Colabo.space puzzles*** (components/packages)
+ We can still use old code within new code, and new code within old code, so no pain
+ You can still continue to program in old AngularJS, but that is not recommended :)
+ we can incrementally migrate to new code

## Advance Models of pseudo-real-time performance

+ Queued/Delayed/Pseudo real-time performance
+ Component for designing sounds queue with parameters

## Advanced Models of real-time performance

+ Colabo.Space : TopiChat
    + Support for sessions
    + Support for chat
    + references to entities (sounds) from chat

## Integration with Art & Science Use Cases

+ Integrate with artistic usecases through Colabo.Space ecosystem
+ Usecases
    + [CoLaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/)
    + [Poetry on the Road](http://colabo.space/colaboarthon/poetry_on_the_road/)
    + DialoGame

### Everydays Heroes (Dresden, Germany)

+ TBD

### Performance at PTW (New York, USA)

**In a nutshell**
+ we are using **collaborative augmentation** Tools and Methodologies (articulated through  [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/)) to help building and rolling **the wheel (a dialogue) between Science->Art->Society**
+ We are starting with **D.C.Engelbart vision** of Collective Intelligence and and ***UN SDGs*** transforming it into a practice with international practitioners of **Performance Activism**
+ We want to offer a great **opportunity of pseudo-real-time performance** for the Open Band at this event, and producing a program music for each performer's performance and performances' fusions
+ We will aim to do ***awareness initiation*** and **psycho-behavioral matching** between musicians and performers to find the best matches. We will do it online with **AI augmented NPL tools @ Colabo.Space**
+ We will **credit work** of PlaySound, Open Band, Audio Common projects and teams

+ PlaySound **Integration with Art & Science** Use Cases
+ [PTW (Perform The World) Conference](https://performingtheworld.pathable.com/), New York, 21-23. September
+ Founded by ***Patch Adams*** and few other key players in Performance Activism

    + [film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams_(film)) with Robin Williams
    + http://www.patchadams.org/
+ Our workshop is focused on [ColaboArthon](http://cha-os.org/colaboarthon/) methodology and [Colabo.space](http://colabo.space/) augmentation technology
+ We are starting with **Science and facts**: [UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) and [Douglas C Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) as futurist, father of GroupWare, computer collaborative augmentation and Collective Intelligence
+ We use (*ColaboArthon, CoEvoLudens, DialoGame*) methodologies augmented with Colabo.Space to translate it into artistic, performing and moving aspect, and using [Vygotsky's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky)  *"[A Head Taller](https://www.joanwink.com/vision-of-vygotsky/vision-of-vygotsky-children-at-play-through-page-115/)"* methodology to transform a vision of ***Collective Mind*** into action
